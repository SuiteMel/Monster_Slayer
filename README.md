## How the App Works
Monster Slayer is a dungeon fighting game. To begin you press start and create a character following the instructions on the screen. Upon confirming your character you will be taken to battle against a monster. There you will hit the attack button until you win or lose in battle.

### Future Update Ideas
* Battle more than one monster
* Allow characters to level up
* Make battle more interesting by adding extra attacks, weapons, etc.
* Animate the characters so the game is visually more exciting.
